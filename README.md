## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains my work for **CS1142: Programming at HW/SW Interface** I completed at **Michigan Technological University** in **Spring 2023**, a systems-level computer science course that bridges the gap between high-level programming and low-level machine operations. The course focused on C programming, MIPS Assembly, memory management, number representations, and data structure manipulation at the hardware/software interface. All code was written from scratch using the Linux terminal and the MARS MIPS simulator.


## ðŸ“‚ Projects & Topics

| # | Program | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Hello MIPS** | Practiced MIPS syscalls, loops, and arithmetic to print number sequences and calculate powers. |
| 2 | **Binary & Arithmetic** | Worked in C to handle binary, hex, decimal conversions and two's complement representation. |
| 3 | **Inventory** | Wrote a MIPS program to traverse and filter a linked list of inventory items stored in memory. |
| 4 | **Finances** | Developed compound interest and stock investment analysis programs using C arrays and formatted I/O. |
| 5 | **Genetic Algorithms** | Implemented a numeric equation solver using genetic algorithms with fitness scoring and mutation logic. |
| 6 | **ASCII Drawing** | Used recursion and 2D arrays in C to create grayscale ASCII art and perform statistical image analysis. |
| 7 | **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** | Built a circular linked list in C and implemented greedy heuristics (Nearest Neighbor, Smallest Increase) to estimate shortest tour paths. |
| 8 | **Movie Reviews (NLP)** | Built a multi-file C application to parse Rotten Tomatoes reviews and perform word-based sentiment analysis. |
| P1 | **Boxes** | Simulates warehouse box stacking and random number generation with custom RNG and statistics output. |
| P2 | **Flashcards** | Implements a spaced repetition flashcard system with interactive quiz features and stats tracking. |
| P3 | **Finances** | Calculates savings and investment scenarios using historical data and command-line I/O in C. |
| P4 | **Genetic Algorithms** | Uses a genetic algorithm to solve equations by evolving candidate solutions over generations.  |


## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with **MIPS Assembly**, memory layout, registers, and syscall-based I/O.
- Developed **modular C programs** using structs, pointers, recursion, and file I/O.
- Practiced **low-level data representation**: binary, hexadecimal, floating-point, and twoâ€™s complement.
- Learned to write and manage **multi-file projects** with proper header files and a **Makefile**.
- Used **Valgrind** and **GDB** to debug, detect memory leaks, and resolve segmentation faults.
- Strengthened problem-solving skills in **graphics, optimization, numerical methods**, and **NLP** domains.
- Built a deep understanding of the hardware/software boundary through real-world computational problems.
