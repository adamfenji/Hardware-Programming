## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains my work for **CS1142: Programming at HW/SW Interface** I completed at **Michigan Technological University** in **Spring 2023**, a systems-level computer science course that bridges the gap between high-level programming and low-level machine operations. The course focused on C programming, MIPS Assembly, memory management, number representations, and data structure manipulation at the hardware/software interface. All code was written from scratch using the Linux terminal and the MARS MIPS simulator.


## ðŸ“‚ Projects & Topics

| # | Program | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [**Hello MIPS**](01.%20Hello%20MIPS) | Practiced MIPS syscalls, loops, and arithmetic to print number sequences and calculate powers. |
| 2 | [**Binary & Arithmetic**](02.%20Binary%20%26%20Arithmetic) | Worked in C to handle binary, hex, decimal conversions and two's complement representation. |
| 3 | [**Inventory**](03.%20Inventory) | Wrote a MIPS program to traverse and filter a linked list of inventory items stored in memory. |
| 4 | [**Finances**](04.%20Finances) | Developed compound interest and stock investment analysis programs using C arrays and formatted I/O. |
| 5 | [**Genetic Algorithms**](05.%20Genetic%20Algorithms) | Implemented a numeric equation solver using genetic algorithms with fitness scoring and mutation logic. |
| 6 | [**ASCII Drawing**](06.%20ASCII%20Drawing) | Used recursion and 2D arrays in C to create grayscale ASCII art and perform statistical image analysis. |
| 7 | [**Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**](07.%20Traveling%20Salesperson%20Problem) | Built a circular linked list in C and implemented greedy heuristics (Nearest Neighbor, Smallest Increase) to estimate shortest tour paths. |
| 8 | [**Movie Reviews (NLP)**](08.%20Movie%20Reviews) | Built a multi-file C application to parse Rotten Tomatoes reviews and perform word-based sentiment analysis. |
| P1 | [**Boxes**](Project%20Boxes) | Simulates warehouse box stacking and random number generation with custom RNG and statistics output. |
| P2 | [**Flashcards**](Project%20Flashcards) | Implements a spaced repetition flashcard system with interactive quiz features and stats tracking. |
| P3 | [**Signal**](Project%20Signal) | Calculates savings and investment scenarios using historical data and command-line I/O in C. |
| P4 | [**Yoober**](Project%20Yoober) | Uses a genetic algorithm to solve equations by evolving candidate solutions over generations.  |




## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with **MIPS Assembly**, memory layout, registers, and syscall-based I/O.
- Developed **modular C programs** using structs, pointers, recursion, and file I/O.
- Practiced **low-level data representation**: binary, hexadecimal, floating-point, and twoâ€™s complement.
- Learned to write and manage **multi-file projects** with proper header files and a **Makefile**.
- Used **Valgrind** and **GDB** to debug, detect memory leaks, and resolve segmentation faults.
- Strengthened problem-solving skills in **graphics, optimization, numerical methods**, and **NLP** domains.
- Built a deep understanding of the hardware/software boundary through real-world computational problems.
